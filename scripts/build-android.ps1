# Cross-compile meitte-cli for Android arm64 and stage it into the example app's jniLibs.
#
# The CLI ships as a `lib*.so` and is launched by the app via ProcessBuilder (no JNI) —
# Android only lets an app execute binaries from its nativeLibraryDir, and only files
# named lib*.so are extracted there, hence the rename.
#
# Requires the Android NDK. Point $env:ANDROID_NDK_HOME at it, or let this script try the
# default SDK location.
#
# CPU target — armv8.2-a + dotprod + fp16, deliberately NOT i8mm. i8mm (armv8.6) is only on
# ~2021+ flagships; a build that pins it SIGILLs during the prefill GEMM on older SoCs (e.g. the
# Snapdragon 865 / OnePlus 8 Pro). dotprod + fp16 (armv8.2, ~2018+) is supported by every SoC
# that can realistically run a >RAM MoE model, so this one binary is device-agnostic across the
# viable device range while keeping every int8/fp16 kernel that matters for Q4_K experts.
#
# Note: ggml's per-device runtime dispatch (GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS + GGML_BACKEND_DL) is NOT used
# because it splits the CPU backend into dlopen'd variant .so's, which drops the bmoe fork's
# statically-linked `ggml_cpu_set_expert_ready_hook` (the I/O–compute overlap hook) — the two are
# mutually exclusive today. A single dotprod baseline keeps overlap and still covers the field.
