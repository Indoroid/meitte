// Unit tests for ngram_draft() (core/src/engine/ngram_draft.cpp) — the prompt-lookup draft source.
//
// The matcher is pure policy over token ids: no model, no llama.cpp, fully deterministic, so it runs
// unconditionally in ctest. That is the point of keeping it on this side of the seam — the drafting
// decision is testable exhaustively, while what it costs is a bench question.
//
// Nothing here can be a byte-identity gate: what the loop does with a draft is verified by a batched
// decode, which is not bit-identical to single-token decodes (see docs/mtp.md). These tests cover the
// decision, not the arithmetic.
//
// Checks are explicit (not <cassert>): the Release build defines NDEBUG, which compiles assert out.
