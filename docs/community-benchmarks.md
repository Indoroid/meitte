# Community benchmarks

Every number in the README came from two machines: one phone, one Windows laptop. The engine runs
unmodified on any Linux or macOS box with a fast drive, and this page exists to answer one
question: **what does expert streaming do on hardware we do not own?**

Ten minutes and a machine is all it takes. Run the protocol, open a
[benchmark report](https://github.com/Helldez/BigMoeOnEdge/issues/new?template=benchmark-report.yml),
and the row lands in the [table below](#results) with your GitHub handle. You do not need to know
the code, and you do not pick any settings: the protocol fixes them so rows compare.

## Start here

**Which model?** Any MoE the engine supports (`bmoe-cli --list-archs`), any quantization. No model
yet? The [catalog table](#models-that-line-up-with-the-readme) lists what the app ships. Larger
than your RAM is the interesting case; one that fits is still a valid row (it measures what
streaming costs against running resident). The report asks which of the two you are in.

### PC or laptop, Linux and macOS

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Helldez/BigMoeOnEdge.git
cd BigMoeOnEdge
scripts/bench-report.sh /path/to/model.gguf
```

It builds the CLI, records your CPU / RAM / drive, measures the drive at the request size the
engine actually issues, runs the protocol, prints two markdown tables. Paste both. Done.

- **No toolchain?** Every release attaches a prebuilt `bmoe-cli` (Linux x86_64 / aarch64, macOS
  arm64, Windows x86_64). Point the script at it: `BMOE_CLI=/path/to/bmoe-cli scripts/bench-report.sh model.gguf`.
- **Binary will not start?** The x86_64 builds assume AVX2, the aarch64 one armv8.2-a with dotprod.
  Drop `BMOE_CLI=` and it builds from source.
- **Windows:** use the prebuilt binary with the command under [On a phone](#on-a-phone), minus the
  `adb shell`. The script itself is Linux and macOS only.

### Android phone

- **Easy path:** install the release APK, load a model from its catalog, generate at least 256
  tokens, screenshot the telemetry panel. Change three settings first, or the row is measuring
  something else: **cold-expert dropping Off** (it defaults to 75 %, which is a lossy speedup),
  **cache Auto**, **context 2048**. Everything else already matches the protocol.
- **Exact path** (comparable with the PC rows): push `bmoe-cli` and run it over adb, see
  [On a phone](#on-a-phone).

Either way the app cannot measure your drive's raw read rate, so a phone row leaves that column
empty unless you run the storage probe yourself.

### Apple hardware

| | Status |
|---|---|
| **Mac**, Apple silicon or Intel | Works. A direct request is served with `F_NOCACHE` (Apple's uncached-descriptor mode — a caching hint, not Linux `O_DIRECT`: no alignment, no DMA promise), and `o_direct` reports what the open actually achieved. Uncached reads can sit below the buffered rate on the same drive, so a Mac row's flash column may read slower than the storage probe suggests; that is the honest number, not a malfunction. Say "macOS" in your report. A 64 or 128 GB Mac is still a row we want. |
| **iPhone, iPad** | Not supported. No iOS target here, and iOS does not run command-line binaries, so reproducing the protocol means building an app around the engine and sideloading it. The core is portable C++ with no Android dependency in the streaming path, so a port is plausible, it just does not exist. |

### What happens to your row

- It lands in the [results table](#results) with your handle.
- Phone rows name the device *class*, never the model, so nothing identifying gets published.
- A slow number is as useful as a fast one. A DRAM-less SSD or a PCIe x1 slot is a result, often
  the most informative kind.

## The protocol

One run, 256 greedy tokens, the same prompt as every README table, settings fixed at what wins on
the reference phone rather than tuned per machine: `min(8, cores)` threads, 4 read lanes,
auto-sized cache, `--overlap`, `--dense-weights anon`, `--ubatch 512` (the same prefill width the
Android app pins, so a host row and an in-app row reserve comparable memory).

Override with an environment variable, and say so in the issue:

| Variable | Default | Change it if |
|---|---|---|
| `THREADS` | `min(8, cores)` | big.LITTLE CPU (try the big-core count), or far more cores than 8 |
| `IO_THREADS` | 4 | NVMe with a deep queue, or a slow SD / USB drive |
| `CACHE_MB` | `auto` | auto left the machine short, or fed the cache so much that `majflt/tok` climbed |
| `UBATCH` | 512 | memory is tight and you will trade prefill width for it, or you want the old full-width behaviour (`UBATCH=0`) |
| `N_PREDICT` | 256 | never below 256, the cache is still warming |

Flags after the model path reach `bmoe-cli` verbatim (`--no-think` for gpt-oss,
`--n-expert-used 6` for a turbo top-k row). A tuned row is welcome, it just sits *next to* the
default row rather than replacing it. To understand the knobs first, see
[benchmark-method.md](benchmark-method.md).

Whatever you run, check the `mode:` line before reporting a number. It says `expert streaming` when
the run measured this engine; if it says `mmap`, `--moe-stream` was missing and the run measured
stock llama.cpp instead. A row like that is still welcome as a baseline, it just has to be labelled
as one.

### On a phone

`bench-report.sh` is Linux and macOS only. On Android, push `bmoe-cli` (from
`scripts/build-android.ps1`, or the aarch64 release binary) and run the same protocol:

```bash
adb push MODEL.gguf /data/local/tmp/
adb shell /data/local/tmp/bmoe-cli -m /data/local/tmp/MODEL.gguf --chatml -n 256 -t 4 --ubatch 512 \
  --moe-stream --cache-mb auto --io-threads 4 --overlap --dense-weights anon \
  --csv /data/local/tmp/run.csv \
  -p "Write a long detailed essay about the history of computing including its origins its key milestones the people involved and the future directions of the field"
```

This command is already the protocol: no dropping, cache auto, the default 2048 context. Three
things to get right around it:

- Stage the model on `/data/local/tmp` or `/sdcard/Download`. **Not** the app's external files dir
  under `/storage/emulated`: it is FUSE-backed and `O_DIRECT` silently falls back to buffered.
- Check `o_direct=1` in the telemetry before trusting the number.
- Phones throttle: run twice, report the second, say if the two differ by more than a few percent.
- The shell runs under a lower CPU frequency cap than a foreground app on some devices, so an adb
  row can read a little slower than the same configuration in the app. Say which one you used.

### Models that line up with the README

Any MoE in any quant is valid, and a different quant of the same model is its own row: expert bytes
per token change with the quant, so the flash column does too. That comparison is one of the things
the table is for. What the app catalog ships:

| Model | Catalog quant | Size | Download | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B | Q4_K_M | 22.3 GB | [bartowski/Qwen_Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Qwen_Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF) | the README's reference row |
| Qwen3-30B-A3B | Q4_K_M | 18.5 GB | [unsloth/Qwen3-30B-A3B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-30B-A3B-GGUF) | |

| gpt-oss-120b | Q4_K_M | 62.8 GB | [unsloth/gpt-oss-120b-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gpt-oss-120b-GGUF) | add `--no-think`; pass the first shard |
| DeepSeek V4 Flash 0731 | UD-IQ2_M | 90.9 GB | [unsloth/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731-GGUF) | pass the first shard |
| Qwen3.8-Flash-Next | UD-IQ3_XXS | 82.0 GB | [unsloth/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GGUF) | needs engine 0.22.0+; pass the first shard |
| Qwen3.8-Flash-Next | Q2_K | 80.4 GB | [DevQuasar/Qwen.Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/DevQuasar/Qwen.Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GGUF) | dense side at 2-4 bit (2.4 GB pinned); no imatrix; pass the first shard |

### What makes a row comparable

The script fills these from the engine's telemetry ([telemetry.md](telemetry.md)). A bare tok/s
without them cannot be placed in the table.

| Column | Meaning | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Decode tok/s, Prefill tok/s | generation and prompt throughput | the headline, and the two are limited by different things |
| Stall s/tok | time per token compute waited on flash | the flash bottleneck, isolated; what NVMe should shrink |
| Compute s/tok | time per token in expert math and cache management | the CPU bottleneck, isolated |
| Flash/token | MiB read from the drive per generated token | whether the cache is working |
| Cache hit | share of expert reads served from RAM | the same, from the other side |
| majflt/tok | major page faults per token | non-zero means the dense weights were being evicted mid-run: the OS, not the engine, is in charge |
| Storage read, 512 KiB O_DIRECT | the drive's raw rate at the engine's request size | the ceiling. Stall far above `Flash/token` over that rate means a request-size or queue problem, not bandwidth |

On a phone, the app's telemetry panel and the CSV from `scripts/bench-run.sh` carry the same fields.

### Doing it honestly

- Nothing else heavy running. A browser with fifty tabs is heavy.
- Passive-cooled boards throttle: run twice, report the second, say if they differ.
- If the storage probe reads far below the drive's rating, say so. That is a result in itself.
- The first run after a download has the file's head in the page cache. The probe skips a quarter
  into the file for exactly that reason; the engine run uses O_DIRECT and is unaffected.

## Results

Ordered by hardware class. "maintainer" rows are the README's, measured with the same protocol over
`adb` on the reference phone and on the Windows laptop. Phone rows name the device class on purpose.

| Hardware | Storage (512 KiB rate) | Model, quant | k | Cache | Decode tok/s | Prefill tok/s | Stall s/tok | Flash/token | Cache hit | Engine | By |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| Phone, 12 GB RAM, Snapdragon class | UFS 4.x (~2300 MiB/s) | Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q4_K_M | 8 | 3000 MiB | 5.0 | n/a | n/a | 144 MiB | 65% | 0.21.0 | maintainer |
| Phone, 12 GB RAM, Snapdragon class | UFS 4.x (~2300 MiB/s) | Qwen3-30B-A3B Q4_K_M | 8 | auto, cap 4000 | 5.2 | n/a | n/a | 225 MiB | 76% | 0.21.0 | maintainer |
| Phone, 12 GB RAM, Snapdragon class | UFS 4.x (~2300 MiB/s) | Gemma-4-26B-A4B Q4_K_M | 8 | 4000 MiB | 4.1 | n/a | n/a | 144 MiB | 82% | 0.21.0 | maintainer |
| Phone, 12 GB RAM, Snapdragon class | UFS 4.x (~2300 MiB/s) | gpt-oss-120b Q4_K_M | 2 | 2000 MiB | 2.2 | n/a | n/a | 590 MiB | 32% | 0.21.0 | maintainer |
| Laptop, x86 8 cores, 16 GB DDR4 | NVMe | Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q4_K_M | 8 | auto | 7.3 | n/a | n/a | 24 MiB | 92% | 0.21.0 | maintainer (`--drop-cold-experts 0.75`) |

Columns the README rows never recorded are `n/a`; rows from `bench-report.sh` fill all of them.
The maintainer rows predate `--ubatch 512` in the protocol, so their compute-buffer reservation was
wider than a fresh row's.
Per-token CSVs for the maintainer rows are under `docs/bench-data/`.

## Open questions

Any hardware is a useful row, including a laptop that looks like every other laptop. These are
just the questions we cannot answer ourselves:

| Question | Hardware that answers it |
|---|---|
| Does a real NVMe queue remove the flash stall the phone shows? | Any mini PC or laptop, PCIe 3.0 x4 drive, 16 GB |
| Where does the >RAM regime start on a fast CPU with plenty of memory? | 32-64 GB DDR5 desktops and mini PCs |
| Is ARM Linux with a drive faster than UFS a different picture? | RK3588, Qualcomm Dragonwing, Raspberry Pi 5 (x1 lane, expected slow, still informative) |
| What happens where a 284B model is only 2x memory? | Unified-memory desktops: Ryzen AI Max, Mac Studio, 64-128 GB |
| Does the phone number hold outside one device? | Any recent Snapdragon, Dimensity or Tensor phone |
| What does the macOS page-cache path actually cost? | Any Mac, see the caveat above |
